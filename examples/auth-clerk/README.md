# MCP Server with Clerk & Next.js

This example demonstrates how to set up a Model Code Protocol (MCP) server endpoint using Next.js and [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication. This integration enables secure authentication for your MCP server, making it ideal for production deployments.

## Features

- üîí Secure authentication with Clerk
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Built with Next.js App Router
- üöÄ One-click deployment

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure Clerk**
   - Create a new application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
   - Enable Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) in your [OAuth settings](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=oauth-applications)
   - Copy your API keys from the [API Keys section](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`
